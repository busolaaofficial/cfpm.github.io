Those who stand for other people in the name of God stands for God Himself.<br/>
We serve God through people. The care we give to people around us in the name of the Lord is to the Lord Himself.<br/>
Mathew 25: 38 – 40<br/>
Whatever people needs are identified and attended to in the name of the Lord. Character of love is displayed.<br/>
That you have the capacity to meet needs in the name of the Lord but neglect it, is a sign that your love for God is not yet complete.<br/>
The display of compassion to others in the name of the Lord is the character of love for God.<br/>
Beloved, let us not be weary in doing good for in due time, we shall harvest the reward if we faint not. Gal 6:9.<br/>
