<div style="line-height:35px; margin-top:5%; font-size:20px;">
The desire of God for His children is first of all that, they should be with Him.<br/>
Whom you spent time with determines whom you look like.<br/>
The place of intimacy is the place for impartation.<br/>
The presence of whom you spent time with always overshadows your appearance.<br/>
Everyone’s endorsement is as a result of the ability to tarry in the presence of the caller.<br/>
Whatever you know of God is what you show.<br/>
You cannot easily understand whom you have not spend time with.<br/>
Your value is in your intimate relationship with the person you serve.<br/>
It is one thing to serve God; it is another thing to know the God you serve. Until you spend time with the God you serve, you cannot know Him better.<br/>
To know the secrets and operations of God, one must develop the habit of staying with Him.<br/>
What a privilege to be called out of multitude. God so much values you that He (God) called you out of the multitude to be with Him, so He can entrust you with divine assignment.<br/>
Staying with Him helps you to discover your utmost assignment.<br/>
Beloved, do not just be bothering serving till you have stayed with Him to know where and how He desires your service.<br/>
