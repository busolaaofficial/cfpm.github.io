—Rom 11 v 33</div>

<div style="line-height:35px; margin-top:5%; font-size:20px;">
Dr. Abraham, a well known cancer specialist, was once on his way to an important conference in another city <br/>where he was going to receive an award in the field of medical research. He was excited about the award and so boarded a plane to the venue. However, two hours after the plane took off; it made an emergency landing at the nearest airport due to a technical problem.
Afraid that he would not make it in time to the conference, he immediately went to the reception to make enquiries. He found out that he would have to wait ten hours for the next flight to his destination! He rented a car and drove himself to the conference city which was four hours away.
Soon after he left, the weather changed and a heavy storm began.<br/>
The downpour made it difficult for him to see so he missed a turn he was supposed to take.<br/>
Driving in the heavy rain on a deserted road, feeling hungry and tired, he frantically began to<br/> look for any sign of civilization. He came across a small tattered house and knocked on the door. A beautiful lady opened the door. He explained his situation and wanted to use the lady’s telephone but she had no telephone. She however asked him to come inside and wait till the weather improved. The doctor who was hungry and exhausted accepted the offer.
The lady offered him something to eat and drink.
She asked him to join her in prayers but he declined. According to him, he believed in hard work, not in prayers! Sitting at the table and sipping his tea, the doctor asked her what exactly she needed from God and asked if God ever listened to her prayers.
When he inquired of the child in the crib, the woman explained that her son was down with cancer. And they had been advised to see a doctor named Abraham who could cure him but she did not have enough money to afford his fee.
She said that God had not yet answered her prayers but said that God would create some way out one day. She added that she would not allow her fears to overcome her faith!
Stunned and speechless, Dr. Abraham began to weep! He was forced to say out loud “GOD IS GREAT” and recollected to the woman, all the sequence of bad events: Malfunction in the plane, a thunderstorm and how he lost his way. All of which had happened because God answers prayers, wanted to give him a chance to come out of his bondage of materialistic career pursuit and give sometime to a poor helpless woman who had nothing but rich prayers.
Oh! What a God!
God may not answer your prayers YOUR WAY but He will always answer His way.
Behind the scenes, He will move men, the weather, events, circumstances etc in order to work out the best for you!<br/>
