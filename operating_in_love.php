Those who operate in love operate in light.<br/>
Families that operate in love do not struggle with devil.<br/>
The more united we are in love, the sweeter the relationship with one another power. Powers of darkness cannot stand those that operate in love.<br/>
Love is also a light that conquers darkness.<br/>
Couples that are engaged in genuine love look alike. They become transform in everything. They operate in one motive and dwell in peace.<br/>
The power of love chases away battles amongst families.<br/>
We live in a generation where Satan wants to separate families through characters that stir up anger and hatred. This must be fought with genuine love.<br/>
Any relationship void of love suffers attack of darkness.<br/>
Beloved, we must allow love to reign in our relationship with people. This is because, our God is love and to be in Him, we must operate in love.<br/>
