<div style="font-size:25px; color:rgb(87, 87, 160); margin-top:2%;">SCRIPTURE: “Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.”<br/>
— Psalm 67 vs 5 – 6.</div>

<div style="line-height:35px; margin-top:5%; font-size:20px;">
Praise is not what we do, awaiting people to come to Church service but the moment to penetrate into the court of heaven. Remember in court, cases are decided. With your praise, your case will be decided in heaven.<br/>
So, when it is done jokingly, your case will be jokingly decided.<br/>
Praise has result to whoever that offers it genuinely. Some of the effects are:<br/>
1.	Increase – Psalm 67 vs 6: Your praise has the capacity to bring the increase of the earth to you.<br/>
2.	Blessings – Psalm 67 vs 6: It connects you to God dimensions of blessing.<br/>
3.	Victory: 2 Chronicles 20 vs 22: Your praise has the capacity to turn your enemies against themselves.<br/>
Beloved, it was prayer mixed with praise that caused earthquake and opened prison doors for Paul and Silas.<br/>
Connecting to God through quality praise is having even more than what has been mentioned above.<br/>
Your praise is your ticket to access divine intervention.<br/>
Note this, refuse to be wearied by challenges of life.<br/>
Instead, turn to God in praise.<br/>
