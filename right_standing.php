How you stand with God defines your stand with yourself and for yourself.<br/>
To be successful in your relationship with God is to be successful in life.<br/>
Everything it takes to be successful in life is completely found in God.<br/>
God does not withhold anything good from those who maintain a right stand with Him.<br/>
Our ability to stand right with God positions us in receiving His grace and glory.<br/>
God’s mercies and faithfulness is ever fresh with the upright.<br/>
Our uprightness defines our forward movement in life and relationship with God.<br/>
God is completely a cover for those who walk uprightly.<br/>
They are people that God does not hide His agenda and intention from. Genesis 18 vs 17, 19.<br/>
Our stand with God define His stand with us.<br/>
