The Bible says, “God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, [Jesus Christ], that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
Jesus said, “I came that they may have life and have it abundantly” — a complete life full of purpose (John 10:10).

<div style="width:100%; font-size:20px; line-height:30px;color:#eee;"><div style="color:gold;font-size:24px;">Here's the problem: people are sinful and separated from God.</div><br/>
We have all done, thought or said bad things, which the Bible calls “sin.” The Bible says, “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).
The result of sin is death, spiritual separation from God (Romans 6:23).<br/>
The good news?

Jesus died in our place so we could have a relationship with God and be with Him forever.<br/>
“God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).<br/>
But it didn’t end with His death on the cross. He rose again and still lives!<br/>
“Christ died for our sins. … He was buried. … He was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).<br/>
Jesus is the only way to God. Jesus said, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me” (John 14:6).<br/>

We can’t earn salvation; we are saved by God’s grace <br/>
when we have faith in His Son, Jesus Christ. All you have <br/>
to do is believe you are a sinner, that Christ died for your <br/>
sins, and ask His forgiveness. Then turn from your sins<br/>
—that’s called repentance. Jesus Christ knows you and loves<br/>
 you. What matters to Him is the attitude of your heart,<br/>
  your honesty. <br/>
  We suggest praying the prayer below to accept Christ as your Savior.<br/>

"Dear God, I know I’m a sinner, and I ask for your forgiveness. I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son. I believe that He died for my sin and that you raised Him to life. I  want to trust Him as my Savior and follow Him as Lord, from this day forward. Guide my life and help me to do your will. I pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen."
