Prayer and praise are tools to access God.<br/>
Prayer is an act of interaction with God through hailing, adoration and commendation.<br/>
I believe that God is capable of helping me so; I call out to Him for help. I also know that God is in the position of helping me so; I command adore and or praise Him.<br/>
Prayer is not powerful to praise as praise is not powerful to prayers.<br/>
Praise and prayers occupies different offices but works hand in hand.<br/>
There cannot be successful prayers without praise and words utters in praise are also words of prayers.<br/>
The Apostles were praying on other tongues but those who heard them interpreted their tongues as praise to God for His wonderful works. Acts 2 vs 11.<br/>
To undermine one to another is to delay yourself of the results thereof.<br/>
Prayer and praise brings you into the presence of God. Psalm 100 vs 4.<br/>
Beloved, the combined force of prayer and praise makes things flow easily.<br/>
Prayer and praise makes things flow easily.<br/>
Prayer and praise are tools for each harvest of answers.<br/>
